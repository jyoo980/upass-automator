# upass-automator

I wrote this script because I got tired of persuading the bus drive that I am a university student every time I forgot to renew my UPASS. Here's what you need:

## Make sure you have the dependencies
1. Download Selenium: `sudo pip install -U selenium`
2. Download the latest chromedriver and put it in your `PATH`, for macOS, `usr/local/bin` is where you want to put it

## To run upass-automator
1. Run `python upass-request.py`
2. Enter your CWL ID and Password when prompted. <strong>Note</strong>, I cannot be responsible for any security vulnerability my exposes that information to, I initially wrote this as a personal side project. 
3. Never get the stink-eye from the bus driver again!
